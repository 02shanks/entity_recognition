This treatment is absolutley disgusting, they have crippled my business for no good reason. I run a small online company and can think of no reason why my account should be closed down. I would advise anyone thinking of opening an account with HSBC to think twice before they do, a simple search online will highlight the fact that I am not the only one who has had their business account closed without warning, HSBC have closed down hundreds of business accounts in the UK without warning or explanation, sort it out HSBC ",NEGATIVE

â€œUnfortunately, youâ€™ve gone over your arranged overdraft limit. Please transfer funds to avoid any charges, or ask us for help.â€. This is the message I received today. Is this some kind of sick joke? Ask us for help? I went into my overdraft some time ago. You increased my overdraft. I went further into it, you increased the limit again, and again. This was my current account, I also had a credit card, I did the same with that and you did the same, increasing the limit. Yes itâ€™s my fault for spending what I didnâ€™t have, I donâ€™t want sympathy from anyone, but I find myself in a hole, a hole which was made bigger by you repeatedly increasing my credit limits. So last week I decided enough is enough, Iâ€™ll phone NatWest and ask for help, not so Iâ€™ve got more to spend but to get a loan so Iâ€™m back at zero, to start again, make my debt manageable. I wonâ€™t be any more in debt but my interest rate will come down and Iâ€™ll have some structure to pay off my debt. After all, NatWest have offered to help. Guess what, my loan application was rejected! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ So Iâ€™m stuck in the hole I created, but NatWest contributed to. And you wonâ€™t help. You are a complete any utter disgrace and I will be taking this further. anybody reading this, STAY WELL CLEAR OF NATWEST. ",NEGATIVE

"I feel your pain.  I was recently subject to fraudulent activity on my account over a 3 month period.  HSBC are entrusted with my money and have failed to do so.   HSBC have not refunded my money or provide me a detailed explanation of why this occurred, or where has the money gone to.  I have not subscribed to any subscriptions but they inform me that I have signed up one, they failed to provide me with an adequate explanation as to why this has happened and have not provided any customer contact number, email address, web address of the supposed company I have apparently subscribed to - I have not.    They have failed to provide an adequate service or keep my account safe which is their responsiblity by law.  I have filed a complaint and I have written to the Financial Ombidsman.    I will also be posting daily updates on every single social media account I can find to report their failure.",NEGATIVE
